Currently there are two notebooks, both of them are __under constructions__.
One can start from features.ipynb to explore the data by yourself.
In the meantime, several py files are implemented for a library for data pipeline. In assemble.py, there are several classes including DataStream, DataDescribe can be used for simple explore. __Be Caution__, Methods API in those classes are still under constructions, may change without notice, please check the latest code to use them. In Visualization.py, there are classes being built for data visualization, stay tune for those.
